Repo for CS5500 Group Project

This project is done my Ka Foon (Kelvin) Siu, Saurav Shah and Vedanta Prusty.

This project is for the CS5500 - Foundations of Software Engineering Class. 

We have designed an end to end program where the user can do the following:
  - Insert data using a json data file
  - Creating a MySQL Schema
  - Run an API to extract data from the database
  - Several webpages to access the data and create/delete data off our database. (Detailed features in the product delivery report (productdeliveryreport.pdf)
